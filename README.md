# üèìFrequency Pong 

A modern twist on the classic Pong game, developed in Unity. Frequency Pong features dynamic sound effects generated through sine waves, making every collision unique. This project combines the simplicity of Pong with interactive audio for a fresh gameplay experience.


## üõ†Ô∏èFeatures

- Dynamic Frequency Sounds: Each collision (paddle, walls, goals) produces a sound generated in real-time using sine waves.
- Score System: Keep track of each player's score, displayed using TextMeshPro (TMP).
- Speed Increase: The ball's speed increases with every paddle hit for added challenge.

## üñ•Ô∏è Languages and Tools Used
- C#: Primary programming language for game logic and audio generation.
- Unity: Game engine used for designing and building the 2D environment.
- TextMeshPro (TMP): For displaying player scores.
- WebGL: To export and make the game playable in browsers.
- Mathf.Sin (Unity API): For generating sine wave audio dynamically.

## üöÄHow to Play

3. Control the paddles to hit the ball. Player 1 uses W/S, and Player 2 uses Up/Down keys.
4. The ball produces a sound upon every collision:
Walls: Produces a high-pitched tone.
Paddles: Produces different tones for each paddle.
Goals: Plays a celebratory tone.
